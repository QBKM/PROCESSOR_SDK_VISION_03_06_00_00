/**
 * @par Description:
 *  Performs normalization of N 8-bit inputs channels with bias producing N 16-bit outputs
 *  channels.
 *
 *  Each W x H 8-bit inputs in an input channel produce W x H 16-bit outputs.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]   *pInChannel   Pointer to N 8-bit input channels
 *   @param [out]  *pOutChannel  Pointer to N 16-bit ouput channels
 *   @param [in]   bias          bias value
 *   @param [in]   shift         Shift value to adjust output to 16 bit
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *   - Input and output addresses are aligned to 8-bytes.
 *   - Widths are assumed to be a multiple of 8
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *      The code is interruptible. <BR>
